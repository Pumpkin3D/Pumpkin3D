  <h1>How to build</h1>
  <p>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    .net: You will need .net to run the most advanced parts of pumpkin in terms of it's code. Along with that it will probably be installed already on your os.
  </p>
  <p>
    Futra: Our own in house Lua runtime, you need this to test and run projects you develop.
  </p>
    <p>
    C: C is something that almost all systems come with, so don't wory at all about intalling it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Optional dependencies</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    A terminal emulator that can display images: Use something like Kitty or a terminal emulator that works well on your system that can display images. (<i>It can be very helpful</i>)
  </p>
  <p>
  <h3>Now it's time to build!</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
Just run the following commands in your terminal (<i><b>You must have git installed on your system.</b></i>
</p>
<p>

    git clone https://github.com/pumpkin3d/pumpkin3d.git
